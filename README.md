# Handwriting Translator ML Project

A machine learning application that recognizes handwritten text using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This project was created as a learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of machine learning and computer vision.

## Features
- Recognizes handwritten digits, letters, and special characters
- Web interface for capturing images via camera or file upload
- Real-time text recognition and display

The model architecture and frontend were developed with significant assistance from AI tools, allowing me to focus on experimenting with the model's capabilities and understanding the underlying ML concepts rather than implementation details.

To run the application, install the requirements and execute `python app.py` from the frontend directory.
